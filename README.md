# Penguins Dataset Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Report

This project involves a comprehensive process of cleaning and exploring the Penguins dataset using Python libraries. Initially, the dataset was loaded from Seaborn and its structure was inspected using methods such as `.head()`, `.info()`, and descriptive statistics to understand its composition and identify potential issues.

Missing values were found in both numerical and categorical columns. To address this, the median was used to fill missing values in numerical features like `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, and `body_mass_g`, while the mode was applied to categorical features such as `species`, `island`, and `sex`. Duplicate records were identified and removed, ensuring data quality. Outliers in key numerical columns (`bill_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`) were detected and treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, mitigating the influence of extreme values. Additionally, categorical values were standardized by converting `sex` to lowercase and `island` to uppercase.

For exploratory data analysis, various visualizations were generated, including histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, violin plots, pair plots, and heatmaps. A grouped analysis comparing average body mass by species and sex provided further insights. Finally, the cleaned dataset was saved for future modeling and analysis tasks.
